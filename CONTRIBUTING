All contributions are welcome, both small and large. Before creating a Pull Request, please first check openstanding issues and other PR's to ensure nobody else is already working on it.
Checking issues also helps fixing bugs faster, which allows me to work on new features.

All contributions towards the Luf language require tests. If a bug was found and fixed, a test is required to verify its functionality but also ensures all edge cases are handled.
