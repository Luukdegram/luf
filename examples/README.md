# Examples

This folder contains simple examples.
Each example can be run by specifying the file name without the `.luf` extension:
```
zig build examples -Dexample=example_file_name
```

For example, to run the loops example use the following command:
```
zig build examples -Dexample=loops
```

More complex and feature-rich examples will be added as the language evolves. Feel free to submit a PR if you have an example you'd like to share.
